# "Model of the Week"

Each week, we post a model to rebuild. Rebuilding a model involves reading the equations, translating them into conventions of the system dynamics software package or programming environment you're using, and replicating the dynamic behavior of the base simulation run. This provides a variety of opportunities that can benefit everyone from someone new to system dynamics to expert modelers with many years of experience:

* If you're new to system dynamics and haven't taken a formal training or course in system dynamics modeling, many rebuilding models a great way to start to learn the language of system dynamics, get familiar wtih the software, and learn how to find and fixing errors.
* If you have already had a course or are more advanced, rebuilding models provides opportunities to maintain your modeling skills, deepen your stock of existing structures, and become familiar with different modeling styles.
* If you're an advanced/expert modeler, rebuilding models in another platform or using a different approach is the cornerstone of replication and comparative modeling. 

# How "Models of the Week" works

Each week, we post a model that can be rebuilt that will include:

1. A diagram of the model.
2. The equations, initial conditions, and simulation setup (e.g., time step, start and end time).
3. Results from the baserun simulation.
4. Any supplemental materials such as a link or paper/chapter of the original model.
5. A "solution" representing a running simulation model (if available) that you can use to compare your model against if you get stuck or run into issues. There can be multiple solutions. Each solution will be on its own branch of the model repository. 
6. To add a solution, go to the model repository, create a branch with your name, and upload your solution to your branch of the model.

The model and related information will be available as part of a public GitHub repository, so you can download the repository into a folder on your computer to work wtih. 

As you rebuild the model, you might have questions about why the modeler chose a specific formulation, find an error, etc. You can search the issues to see if others have run into this before and see the answers, or create a new issue if it is new and start a discussion thread. If you create an issue or respond to a discussion thread, it can be helpful to copy and paste a screenshot of what you're referring to and attach the model you're working on.
